# â˜• Central Perk, the place where friends meet - The JS World Clock 

Central Perk Clock is a World Clock application inspired by the iconic american television sitcom "[Friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends)".
The application utilizes Moment.js & Moment Timezone.js libraries to parse, validate, manipulate, and display dates and times in any timezone in JavaScript.

## Features

The homepage features a drop-down menu displaying the date and time of different time zones.
I chose to showcase different cities based on where my friends currently live or travel.

## Design inspo

I chose to highlight the iconic elements found in the series such as Monica's peephole frame, Phoebe's acoustic guitar, the couch from Central Perk and many more.
The background was built using watery strokes design available [here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/115826849/Friends-TV-show-Illustration-design) which I adapted using Canva.
